## 🧠 **Project Description**
This project highlights a major issue in today’s education system — the growing **gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application**.  
Our aim is to bridge this gap by promoting **hands-on learning experiences**, **real-world problem-solving**, and **critical thinking** among students.

## ⚙️ **Problem Description**

### 1. 📚 Focus on Theory  
Students are primarily focused on syllabus-based theoretical learning designed for scoring marks in schools, colleges, or competitive exams.

### 2. 🧩 Lack of Practical Application Training  
Students are rarely taught how the knowledge they gain can be applied to real-world scenarios.

### 3. 💭 Limited Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving Skills  
Due to excessive focus on rote learning, students often lack essential critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

### 4. 💻 Exam-Focused Online Content  
Most online resources (YouTube, Google, etc.) emphasize exam preparation or trending topics, rather than real-life skill development.

> 🧾 **In summary:**  
> The project identifies that the current education system emphasizes **theoretical learning** over **practical understanding**, leading to poor problem-solving and creative thinking skills among students.
